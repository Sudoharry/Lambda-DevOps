## This Python script uses AWS services like EC2, S3, CloudWatch, and SES to automate several infrastructure tasks within AWS, running within an AWS Lambda function. 

1. Logging and AWS Client Initialization:
- Configures logging using Python's built-in logging module.
- Initializes AWS clients (ec2, s3, cloudwatch, ses) using boto3 to interact with AWS services.

2. SES Email Setup:
- Retrieves environment variables SES_FROM_EMAIL (verified SES sender email) and SES_TO_EMAIL (recipient email address) for sending notifications via Amazon SES.

3. Tagging Compliance:
- DEFAULT_TAGS are defined as required tags for EC2 instances (e.g., Owner, Project, Environment, Testing).
- The enforce_compliance_tags function checks if the required tags are applied to a resource. If any required tags are missing, they are applied and an email notification is sent about the update.
- The auto_tag_resources function iterates over EC2 instances and applies the necessary tags using enforce_compliance_tags.

4. Scheduled Cleanup:
  This function manages resource cleanup tasks for unused EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and S3 buckets:
 - Terminate Stopped EC2 Instances:
   - It checks for stopped EC2 instances that have been idle for over 7 days and terminates them.
 - Delete Unused EBS Volumes:
   - It deletes EBS volumes that are not attached to any instance (status: available).
 - Delete Old S3 Buckets:
   - It deletes S3 buckets that were created over 30 days ago.
 - For each cleanup action, an email is sent to notify about the action performed (instance termination, volume deletion, bucket deletion).

5. Dynamic Scaling:
- This function monitors the CPU utilization of a specific EC2 instance (replace 'your-instance-id' with the actual instance ID).
- If CPU utilization exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 80%), it triggers an email notification indicating high CPU usage, and could potentially trigger scaling actions (though the scaling actions themselves are not fully implemented in the provided code).

6. Lambda Handler:
- The lambda_handler function is the main entry point for the Lambda execution. It runs the following tasks in sequence:
  - Auto-tag resources: It checks EC2 instances for compliance with required tags.
  - Scheduled cleanup: It performs cleanup tasks like terminating old EC2 instances, deleting unused EBS volumes, and removing old S3 buckets.
  - Dynamic scaling: It checks the CPU utilization of EC2 instances and triggers scaling if needed.
- Once all tasks are complete, it sends a final email summarizing the execution status.

7. Email Notifications:
- The send_email function sends email notifications via Amazon SES. It is used throughout the script to send alerts for:
 - Tagging compliance updates.
 - Cleanup tasks.
 - High CPU utilization triggering scaling.
 - A final summary of all infrastructure automation tasks.

## Key Components:
- EC2 Instances: The script interacts with EC2 instances by applying tags and managing their state (terminating stopped instances).
- EBS Volumes: It deletes unused EBS volumes (those with status available).
- S3 Buckets: It deletes old S3 buckets based on their creation date.
- CloudWatch Metrics: The script checks EC2 CPU utilization using CloudWatch metrics and can trigger scaling actions based on CPU usage.
- Amazon SES: Used to send email notifications about the tasks being executed, such as updates on EC2 instance tags, terminated instances, deleted volumes, and scaling actions.

## Summary:
This Lambda function automates infrastructure management tasks, such as tagging compliance, resource cleanup (EC2, EBS, S3), and dynamic scaling, while keeping you informed via email notifications sent through Amazon SES. It is useful for automating routine cloud management tasks to optimize resources, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with tagging standards.
